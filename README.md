# Game Library App

## Description

For school we needed to make a App with some conditions. In this app I make a connection with my api (https://github.com/RoelVoordendag/RestfulGameApi) and with async I collect the data and you see all your games in a listview and scroll through them. In the app you can also add new games to the api with a post. 

#### API level 23
